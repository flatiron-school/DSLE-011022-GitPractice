# Guided Git GIF-STRAVAGANZA (DS-Live-East-011022)

Today's challenge is to contribute to a Git repository, using branches and pull requests! We'll be using a *Git branching workflow* so we can all contribute to this README file.

## Steps

1. Accept the invite to collaborate on this repository (should be an email sent to the email address associated with your GitHub account - will be sent out at the start of the Guided Session)
2. Clone down this repository (**don't fork it!**) to a good place on your computer
3. Create a new branch on your local repository (I recommend naming your branch after yourself, so my branch will be named _Lindsey_)
4. Find a GIF or image that summarizes how you're feeling today
5. Use Markdown syntax and a text editor to add the GIF or image to this README.md file **under your name**
6. Add and commit your local changes to your branch
7. Push **your branch** to this repository (this step will not work if you forgot to checkout a branch in step 2!)
8. Start a pull request for me to review

I will either accept your pull request, or send you feedback on what you need to do to improve!
